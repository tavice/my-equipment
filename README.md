## Description
My first full CRUD web app. I am a general contractor and I got the idea of this app when I had to request some specific equipment/vehicles delivered to my jobsite. My shop manager/mechanics is currently using an Excel spreadsheet to keep track of all the information and I thought it would be good to have an app that properly displays the status of the equipment
